EXPLANATION:
HERE I AM USING HASHSET TO STORE THE ELEMENTS OF THE LINKED LIST.
BY TRANSVERING THROUGH LINKED LIST I AM CHECKING IF THE ELEMENT IS ALREADY PRESENT IN THE SET ,THE ELEMENT WILL BE REMOVED BY POINTING PREVIOUS ELEMENT'S ADDRESS TO NEXT ELEMENT.
AND IF ELEMENT IS NOT PRESENT WE WILL SIMPLY ADD THE ELEMENT AND UPDATE THE CUREENT NODE.

CODE:

HashSet<Integer> hs = new HashSet<>(); 
      
        Node current = head; 
        Node prev = null; 
        
        while (current != null)  
        { 
            int curval = current.data; 
              
            if (hs.contains(curval)) { 
                prev.next = current.next;
                current=null;
            }
            else { 
                hs.add(curval); 
                prev = current; 
            }
            current = prev.next; 
        } 
        return head;
