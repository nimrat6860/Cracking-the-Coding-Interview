EXPLANATION:
HERE WE HAVE SIMPLY USE CONTAINS FUNCTION.
WE WILL CHECCK IF GOAL LENGTH IS EQUAL TO STR LENGTH AND ALSO IF (STR+STR) CONTAINS GOAL IT MEANS IT IS ROTATED.
HENCE WE WILL RETURN TRUE.

CODE:
 boolean rot(String st,String str)
    {
        String s=str+str;
        if(goal.length()==str.length()&&s.contains(goal))
            return true;
        return false;
    }
