EXPLANATION:


AS WE KNOW WE CAN NOT ACCESS ELEMENT FROM LAST OF LINKED LIST
SO IN THIS PROGRAM WE WILL FIND THE ELEMENT FROM BEGINNING 
BY FINDING THE LENGTH OF LIST AND SUBSTRACT INDEX OF ELEMENT FROM LENGTH.
AND FINALLY WILL GET THE ELEMENT.

SOLUTION:

class Solution
{
    //Function to find the data of nth node from the end of a linked list.
    int getNthFromLast(Node head, int n)
    {
        Node temp=head;
        int c=0;
        while(temp!=null)
        {
            c++;
            temp=temp.next;
        }
        if (c<n)
            return -1;
        int index=c-n+1;
        Node curr=head;
       for(int i=1;i<index;i++)
       {
           curr=curr.next;
       }
        return curr.data;
    }
}
